**[Firestorm](https://www.firestormviewer.org/) is a free client for 3D virtual worlds such as Second Life and various OpenSim worlds where users can create, connect and chat with others from around the world.** This repository contains the official source code for the Firestorm viewer.

## Open Source

Firestorm is a third party viewer derived from the official [Second Life](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer) client. The client codebase has been open source since 2007 and is available under the LGPL license.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not provide support for compiling the viewer or issues resulting from using a self-compiled viewer.
