**[Firestorm](https://www.firestormviewer.org/) is a free client for 3D virtual worlds such as Second Life and various OpenSim worlds where users can create, connect and chat with others from around the world.** This repository contains the official source code for the Firestorm viewer.

## Open Source

Firestorm is a third party viewer derived from the official [Second Life](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer) client. The client codebase has been open source since 2007 and is available under the LGPL license.

## Download

Pre-built versions of the viewer releases for Windows, Mac and Linux can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.firestormviewer.org/choose-your-platform/).

## Build Instructions

Build instructions for each operating system can be found in the official [wiki](https://wiki.firestormviewer.org/).

- [Windows](https://wiki.firestormviewer.org/fs_compiling_firestorm_windows)

- [Mac](https://wiki.firestormviewer.org/fs_compiling_firestorm_macos)

- [Linux](https://wiki.firestormviewer.org/fs_compiling_firestorm_linux)

Please note that we do not provide support for compiling the viewer or issues resulting from using a self-compiled viewer. However, there is a self-compilers group within Second Life that can be joined to ask questions related to compiling the viewer: [Firestorm Self Compilers](secondlife:///app/group/2014ce4c-5393-fb67-83ac-910db84c273c/about)
